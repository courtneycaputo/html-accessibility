# html-accessibility

Module 1 Challenge: update the HTML and CSS to meet accessibility standards and update the index.html with semantic HTML and the CSS to fit the updated semantic HTML elements

Changes made:
- updated title tag to Marketing Agency's name
- changed all div tags to proper HTML5 tags, such as header, footer, section, aside, or nav
- changed the class for the services just to "service" instead of having 3 separate classes, as each one had the same styling
- changed the class for the benefits to just "benefit" instead of having 3 separate classes, as each one had the same styling
- added comments to css file to explain what each section was for
- added alt descriptions on each image for accessibility
